BankOnline is a semi-finished project, or we can say a model. (JEE, Java Server Pages, Servlet, Server Tomcat, Junit) 
We would create a bank on line. We have finished some operations, sign-up, login, transfer accounts, login-staff, administration of customers, administration of operations, etc. 
(Please configurate a localhost server Tomcat to use this web application.)
I am sorry that it can not be launched normally because of an update of university database.
